- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For Every Logic Purpose we use TS.
- [SaSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS for styles.
- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en) - Node js 
- [React](https://react.dev/) - React Js

#### If you are not using react for creating your website then you can check our JS Library DG Style.
